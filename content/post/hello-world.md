So I started a blog. Technically, I've started a blog again. I'm kind of
hoping my first attempts have been so totally buried that no one can prove they
exist, but those are kind of important because they're sort of arguments
against blogging again: it takes energy to say anything interesting.

So why start this blog (again)? Because since I graduated college I've been
having information problems. Not serious information problems, but still
annoying information problems. Like I'll do projects  but I end up with these
long narratives in comments or github issues, and while I think all the history
is useful (it contextualizes why I'm doing what I'm doing), it's also a lot to
parse, maybe too much for those mediums. Or I'll read an interesting book or
research paper and try and organize my thoughts on Google Drive, but that leads
to a mess of documents that aren't really searchable, and aren't really useful
in sharing ideas with other people. No one but me is ever going to see
my Google Drive.

So I'm hoping to export some instances of my internal monologue that are too
close to personal narrative to use in more technical documents but still maybe
useful as context for the design and application of computing systems. Maybe
I'll call them something complicated, like "pseudo-narrative contexts", to
express how out-there-but-maybe-useful they are. And of course, because I'm
trying to organize my thoughts for future use I'm going to try and categorize
them. To incentivize me to do a good job at all of this I'm going to do this in
a way that's publically visible.

And that's why I'm making a blog. To get better at sharing things I've learned
by practicing.

If you're reading this I hope I succeeded in recording something interesting.

Happy reading.
