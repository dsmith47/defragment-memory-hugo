## About Me

I'm lifelong nerd looking for tools to improve people's lives.
My opinions are my own, even when I'm employed by someone else.

## Longer Resume

I've spent most of my academic career picking up part-time work, and as a
result I have a bit of trouble fitting everything on one page. There probably
isn't enough academics to consider this a CV, but if I'm talking about an
experience that isn't on the 1-page resume you might find it here.
